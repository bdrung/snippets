    """Return a new naturally sorted list from the items in *iterable*.

    The returned list is in natural sort order. The string is ordered
    lexicographically (using the Unicode code point number to order individual
    characters), except that multi-digit numbers are ordered as a single character.

    Has two optional arguments which must be specified as keyword arguments.

    *key* specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison
    key from each list element: ``key=str.lower``.  The default value is ``None``
    (compare the elements directly).

    *reverse* is a boolean value.  If set to ``True``, then the list elements are
    sorted as if each comparison were reversed.

    The :func:`natural_sorted` function is guaranteed to be stable. A sort is
    stable if it guarantees not to change the relative order of elements that
    compare equal --- this is helpful for sorting in multiple passes (for
    example, sort by department, then by salary grade).
